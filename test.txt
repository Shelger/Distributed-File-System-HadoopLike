"We just want to put ourselves in position to be able to compete for a championship," James said after the Lakers' 134-109 win. "It's a journey, and obviously we don't have as much chemistry as a lot of other teams trying to compete for a championship or that have aspirations to win a championship, but I like what we've been building over the last month or so.


"Even when I was out for the four weeks, I liked what we've been building and I'm happy to be back in the mix."

In James' fourth game back following a monthlong absence because of a torn tendon his right foot, the 20-year veteran put up 18 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to register the 107th triple-double of his career, tying him with Jason Kidd for No. 4 on the all-time list.
